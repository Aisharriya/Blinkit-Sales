## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a **Power BI dashboard** for **Blinkit**, a grocery retailer, aimed at enhancing business decision-making through data insights. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution, enabling Blinkit to identify trends and areas for improvement.

## Key Objectives
- **Sales Performance Analysis**: Examine sales trends and levels of customer satisfaction.
- **Inventory Distribution Insights**: Analyze how inventory impacts performance across various products and locations.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Support strategic planning with insights derived from key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Data Overview
The analysis utilizes a dataset containing detailed information on grocery items and Blinkit outlets, including attributes like fat content, item type, visibility, and sales data. Data was imported from an Excel file titled “BlinkIT Grocery Data.xlsx” for real-time updates.

## Methodology
### Data Cleaning and Quality Assurance
- Handled missing values and standardized categorical data to ensure reliability.
- Validated data types for consistency across the dataset.
### Data Modeling
- Implemented a star schema model with fact and dimension tables to facilitate efficient querying and analysis using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
### Dashboard Design
- User-friendly layout with filters for easy data segmentation.
- Key metrics displayed prominently for quick insights.

## Key Findings
1. **Health Trends**: Increased sales of low-fat items in specific outlets indicate a shift towards healthier choices.
2. **High-Performing Categories**: "Fruits and Vegetables" drive significant sales.
3. **Outlet Stability**: Older outlets show more stable sales patterns.
4. **Geographic Patterns**: Tier 1 locations exhibit stronger sales due to higher purchasing power.
5. **Optimal Outlet Size**: Medium-sized outlets yield the highest sales.

## Recommendations
- **Optimize Inventory**: Increase stock of high-demand items, especially low-fat products.
- **Targeted Marketing**: Focus campaigns on successful products in medium-sized Tier 1 outlets.
- **Expansion Strategy**: Consider replicating successful elements in new regions with similar characteristics.

The dashboard serves as a powerful tool for Blinkit to enhance operational efficiency and better meet customer needs through informed decision-making.
